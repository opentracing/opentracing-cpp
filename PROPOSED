# Virtual inheritance model

## Pros
* Traditional OO/Simpler (major)
* Decouples Tracer from span/carrier
* Moves physical organization problem into carriers, (still messy, but much better than defining details in tracer)

##Cons
* Spec adjustment, requiring reset/externalize for carrier fallback
* More complicated carrier code (minor)
* more expensive 'no-ops', always hit v-table (minor)
* No longer header only. Tracer singleton interface requires static storage is defined (more annoying, but still minor)
