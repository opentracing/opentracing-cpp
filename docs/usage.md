# opentracing-cpp

This file describes how clients can instrument their applications with the `opentracing-cpp`
API. It assumes you have finished the required reading outlined [here](../README.md).

### Outline

The `opentracing-cpp` interface uses the [Curiously Recurring Template Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern)
(CRTP) to define a set of compile time, polymorphic interfaces to `OpenTracing` implementations.

In order to trace their systems, clients must:

 - Select their `opentracing-cpp` implementation
 - Install the selected `Tracer` in their applications in main
 - Use the API's Tracer interface to instrument their applications requests


### Select the implementation

`opentracing-cpp` only defines the interfaces. In order to make any use of the
API, you will need to install a concrete `Tracer` implementation. To do so, it is
best practice to first create an reusable header you can share throughout your
organization that declares the implementation you will be using.

This header should provide a few typedefs that make it easy to swap implementations
later.

```
// acme_tracing.h
#ifndef INCLUDED_ACME_TRACING
#define INCLUDED_ACME_TRACING

// Include the interface templates
#include <opentracing/tracer.h>

// Include the chosen implementation
#include <opentracing/noop.h>

namespace acme {
    typedef opentracing::NoopTracer TracerImpl;

    typedef opentracing::GenericTracer<
                opentracing::NoopTracer,
                opentracing::NoopSpan,
                opentracing::NoopOptions,
                opentracing::NoopContext,
                opentracing::NoopAdapter> Tracer;
    // Tracer is required for O(1) implementation swaps

    typedef Tracer::SpanContext SpanContext;
    typedef Tracer::SpanOptions SpanOptions;
    typedef Tracer::Span        Span;
    // For convenience
}
#endif
```

By creating the `Tracer` typedef, we can now rely on the GenericTracer interface,
but avoid knowing any of the explicit implementation details in client code.

The `Tracer` exposes a number of public typedefs which make it easier to create our
types:

 - `Tracer::Span`             - Interface to Span objects
 - `Tracer::SpanContext`      - Interface to SpanContext objects
 - `Tracer::SpanOptions`      - Interface to SpanOptions objects

Our theoretical "ACME Inc." organization can use these type names to instrument their applications.
The `Tracer` typedef is not standardized, but it is recommended. The rest of the documentation
will assume that `Tracer` was the chosen name for the Tracer type.

If clients ever require that they swap `OpenTracing` implementations, they
will need to update only this header file and rebuild applications.
(Easier said then done for larger organizations...)

### Installing the Tracer

Once a implementation is chosen, your applications can rely on your global `opentracing-cpp`
configuration header to set up the `Tracer`. The `Tracer` implementation singleton is installed
explicitly in main. This must be done before any other parts of the API can be used:

```
// acmetask.m.cpp
#include <acme_tracing.h>

using namespace acme;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
    TracerImpl tracerImpl;
    Tracer::install(&tracerImpl);

    // ...

    return 0;
}

```

### Creating Spans

Once the `Tracer` is installed, we can begin to instrument the application.
Say we have a service that acts as a proxy to a number of other HTTP servers.
We may have a `getAccount` handler that reaches out to a user account service.

To trace our application, we'll first need to start the span:

```
// requesthandler.m.cpp
#include <acme_tracing.h>

using namespace acme;

int getAccount(Repsonse * resp, const Request& req)
{
    Tracer* tracer = Tracer::instance();

    Span* span(tracer->start("get_account"));
    assert(span);

    // ...

    span->finish();
    tracer->cleanup(span);

    return 0;
}
```

### Defining carriers

In order to instrument our entire network, we need a way to `inject` and `extract`
spans into and out of our RPC calls. Extending our example, when we make our request
to the backend HTTP service, we'll need a way to inject the details of the context
into our outgoing HTTP request.

We'll define our HttpWriter inline with our request to do the `inject` part of this
process first. In practice, you'll want the Writers/Readers you use to be consistent
across your organization, so putting them into a library would be ideal.

```
#include <opentracing/carriers.h>

using namespace opentracing;
using namespace acme;

class HttpWriter : public GenericBinaryWriter<HttpWriter>
{
  public:
    HttpWriter(HttpRequest * req) : m_req(req)
    {
    }

    int injectImp(const void* blob, const size_t len)
    {
        std::string header(static_cast<const char* const>(blob), len);
        req->addHeader("x-acme-tracing-blob", header);
        return 0;
    }

  private:
    HttpRequest* m_req;
};

int getAccount(Repsonse* resp, const Request& req)
{
    Tracer* tracer = Tracer::instance();

    Span* span(tracer->start("get_account"));
    assert(span);

    HttpResponse httpResponse;
    HttpRequest  httpRequest(req);

    HttpWriter writer(&httpRequest);
    tracer->inject(&writer, span->context());

    sendHttpRequest(&httpResponse, httpRequest);

    // ...

    span->finish();
    tracer->cleanup(span);
    return 0;
}
```

On the server side of the HTTP request, we'll want to continue the original Trace by creating
a new SpanContext as a 'child of' the original:

```
#include <opentracing/carriers.h>

using namespace opentracing;
using namespace acme;

struct HttpReader: public GenericBinaryReader<HttpReader>
{

  public:
    int extractImp(std::vector<std::string> * const buf) const
    {
        std::string header = m_req.getHeader("x-acme-tracing-blob");

        if (!header.empty())
        {
            buf->assign(header.begin(), header.end());
            return 0;
        }
        else
        {
            return 1;
        }
    }

  private:
    const HttpRequest& m_req;
};

int httpGetAccount(const HttpRequest& httpRequest)
{
    Tracer* tracer = Tracer::instance();

    SpanContext* context(tracer->extract(HttpReader(httpRequest)));

    Span* span;

    if (!context)
    {
        span = tracer->start("get_account");
    }
    else
    {
        SpanOptions* opts(tracer->makeSpanOptions());

        opts->setReference(SpanReferenceType::e_ChildOf, *context);
        opts->setOperation("get_account_server");

        span = tracer->start(opts);

        tracer->cleanup(context);
        tracer->cleanup(opts);
    }
    assert(span);

    // Send back our response...

    span->finish();
    tracer->cleanup(span);

    return 0;
}
```

### Tags, Logs, and Baggage

The [OpenTracing specification](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md) outlines how
users should be able tag their spans, log structured data for a span, or attach arbitrary baggage that propagates
through the entire system.

##### Tags
The `opentracing-cpp` interface allows you to tag your spans with `key:value` pairs:

```
Span* span = tracer->start("get_bookmarks");
span->tag("account", account_id);
span->tag("site", site);
```

The `key` must be a string, but the value can be any type that can be externalized via

`std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Type& t)`.


##### Logs
The `log` functions work similarly, but logs are also implicitly associated with the current wall-time as well.
Users can control the time-stamp behavior if they wish by providing it explicitly:

```
Span* span(tracer->start("get_bookmarks"));
span->log("db_access", account_id);             // Use current wall-time
span->log("redis_access", site, 1484003943000); // Accessed redis on Jan 9, 2017 at 23:19:02 GMT
```

##### Baggage
Baggage is special. It is a set of text-only, key:value pairs that propagates with traces as they make their way
through a system. It can be prohibitively expensive if abused. It is also not a replacement for traditional message
schemas (e.g., protobuf). Care must be taken when adding any baggage.

Baggage can be added directly to any Span you create through the underlying SpanContext.

```
Span* span = tracer->start("get_bookmarks");
span->context().setBaggage("database", std::to_string(database_id));
span->context().setBaggage("user", user);
```

Baggage can also be read back through the original Span or SpanContexts extracted from carriers.
Note that SpanContexts created through 'extract()' are read-only.

```
Span* span(tracer->start("get_bookmarks"));

span->context().setBaggage("database", std::to_string(database_id));
span->context().setBaggage("user", user);

for(SpanContext::BaggageIterator it = span->context().baggageBegin();
                                 it != span->context().baggageEnd();
                               ++it)
{
    std::cout << "baggage item: " << it->key() << " val: " << it->value()
              << std::endl;
}
```

If you have access to C++11 features, we can use the range based for loop syntax too.

```
HttpReader reader(request);
SpanContext* context(tracer->extract(reader));

for(const auto& baggage : context->baggageRange())
{
    std::cout << "baggage item: " << baggage.key()
              << " val: " << baggage.value() << std::endl;
}
tracer->cleanup(context);
```
